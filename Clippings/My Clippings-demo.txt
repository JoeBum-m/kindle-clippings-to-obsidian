# The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business

### Highlights
- It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it. â€”JACOB BRONOWSKI, WRITER AND PRESENTER OF THE ASCENT OF MAN
- Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price theyâ€™re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaserâ€™s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.
